# Unit::Blocked takes Motion::Reason bits (P5-C2). Its UnitState overload is deleted, so one
# unit-state constant passed to it is a compile error; but an ORed mask of unit-state constants
# is an int, binds to Blocked(uint32) and would be read as reason bits (UNIT_STAT_MELEE_ATTACKING
# is ReasonRooted's bit, UNIT_STAT_ATTACK_PLAYER ReasonStunned's, UNIT_STAT_ISOLATED
# ReasonConfused's). This gate refuses any Blocked( call whose argument names a UNIT_STAT_
# constant, in the core and in the scripts (P5-C3), and checks the deleted overload still stands.
#
# Usage: cmake -DSOURCE_ROOT=<repo root> -P CheckBlockedMasks.cmake
# Limitation: the regex reads a call's argument up to its first ')'; a mask built in a variable
# first would escape it. None is today.
