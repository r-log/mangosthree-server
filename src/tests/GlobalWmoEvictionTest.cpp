/**
 * @file
 * @brief A map built from one global WMO must not be resident for ever.
 *
 * The tile cache sweeps a (tx, ty) grid. A map with no ADT grid has one tile that
 * belongs to no cell, so it is not reachable from that loop and was never dropped
 * once loaded. The map-level release (TerrainManager::UnloadTerrain) covered the
 * common case, but it returns early when GridUnload is 0 while the sweep below
 * keeps running -- so under that setting the tile was resident for the life of
 * the process, across every such map ever visited. 68 of them ship with the
 * client, 80 MB in total.
