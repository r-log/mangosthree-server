# 42 opcode names whose value disagrees with every independent 4.3.4 source and
# which nothing currently builds or dispatches. They are inert TODAY. Adopting
# one without correcting its value ships a silent no-op -- an SMSG the client
# discards, or a CMSG handler that never runs.
#
# The rule is deliberately blunt: any non-comment appearance of a denylisted
# name in src/game is a violation, full stop. An earlier version of this gate
# only matched a value bound to a named local on a single line -- "WorldPacket
# foo(NAME, ...)" -- which a wrapped constructor argument or an unnamed
# temporary (SendPacket(WorldPacket(NAME, 0))) walks straight past. There is no
# safe narrower shape to look for: the client does not care how the value
# reached it, only that it did.
#
# The one exemption is OPCODE(SMSG_..., ...) in OpcodeTable.cpp: a
# STATUS_NEVER + Handle_ServerSide table-completeness placeholder, never a
# dispatch target, because the server never receives an SMSG. A CMSG/MSG
# registration gets no such pass -- a wrong value there leaves a handler that
# is wired up and simply never runs, which is the exact failure this gate
# exists to catch.
#
# One alternation regex is built from all 42 names and matched once per line,
# rather than 42 names times two hand-written patterns times every line. The
# per-name loop cost 235 seconds over src/game -- as much as a warm build --
# for a gate meant to run on every configure.
