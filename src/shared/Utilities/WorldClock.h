/**
 * @brief The process clock: the single source of "now" behind getMSTime() (movement P0-D).
 *
 * In real mode NowMs() is the steady clock since the process started. While the GM
 * harness steps the world, NowMs() is a counter only Step() moves, so a scenario's
 * timing does not depend on how fast the machine runs it. Leaving stepped mode keeps
 * an offset, so the clock never runs backwards; it then stays ahead of real time by the
 * run's virtual length, which every consumer tolerates since all of them are relative.
 * NowUnix() keeps following the OS wall clock in real mode -- including any adjustment
 * an NTP step or a VM pause makes to it -- rather than being derived from the steady
 * clock, since about sixty call sites elsewhere still read time(NULL) directly and must
 * not diverge from it. A stepped run instead derives its seconds from an anchor taken
 * at EnterStepped() plus the counter's advance, and leaving keeps a seconds lead the
 * same way NowMs() keeps a milliseconds one. The world thread is the only writer; any
 * thread may read.
