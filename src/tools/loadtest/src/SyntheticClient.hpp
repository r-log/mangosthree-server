// One synthetic 4.3.4 client: both world streams, from the TCP connect to a
// character standing in the world.
//
// What it is for. This fork routes a session's traffic across two sockets, and
// today only 19 opcodes are gated onto the second one -- a measured 98.9 / 1.1
// split. Deciding what SHOULD go where needs a way to put a known number of real
// sessions on a server and watch what the split does to them, and no such thing
// exists: a WoW client cannot be scripted, and the tree's only socket test
// (NetworkStressTest) speaks bytes rather than the protocol. This is the client
// half of that instrument.
//
// It is NOT a bot. It logs in, holds the session, answers what must be answered,
// and reports where it got to. Nothing here plays the game.
//
// Why realmd is skipped. The login server exists to agree a session key with the
// client over SRP-6 and write it into `account.sessionkey`. A synthetic client
// can simply be TOLD that key: with the row already carrying it, CMSG_AUTH_SESSION
// proves possession exactly as a real client's would, over the same SHA-1 and the
// same secret. That removes an entire protocol and an entire server from the
// harness without weakening a single check the world server performs.
