/**
 * Which units one client may move, and the one it has selected (design v2 §7,
 * F1). Membership changes only through the server's control transitions --
 * login, possession, a vehicle's control seat, and their releases -- and the
 * client's CMSG_SET_ACTIVE_MOVER / CMSG_MOVE_NOT_ACTIVE_MOVER select and
 * deselect a member. A movement packet is honoured for the selected unit only;
 * an ack for any member, because a change sent to the player is answered as
 * the player while the vehicle is selected. Every refusal is counted and the
 * packet dropped; thresholds are a later rung of the ladder (§10.1). The
 * session owns one; it runs in the map phase like the packets it judges, so
 * its counters are plain.
 *
 * A real client deselects the unit it stops moving, not the one it starts
 * moving: on a grant of another unit it names the one it leaves, and on a
 * revoke of its own control it names itself. Both land after the set has
 * already pre-selected the new unit, or cleared the old one, so the named
 * guid is the base player, a current or former member, or the unit just
 * removed -- never the selection itself, except the ordinary case where it
 * still is. Only a stranger's guid is a bad deselect.
