// The taxi flight (P5-B family 5): TaxiBehaviour replaces FlightPathMovementGenerator, the last
// legacy generator, deleted on this branch with LegacyBehaviour and MovementGenerator. It owns
// the whole journey the shell hands it as one welded node array: one spline per map through the
// driver, the nodes' events, the route's seams, the map crossings and the landing, all at the
// server's clock. It never waits on a client packet. The shell's six taxi operations
// (Player::Taxi*) are asked for by name through the effects; nothing else of the shell is known.
