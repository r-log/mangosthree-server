 * which holds a set of claims by identity (§4.1); three policies between
 * them (§4.2); every public operation is a transaction whose generation
 * decides whether a request issued from inside a hook survives (§4.3); a
 * fixed ring of decisions for the GM dump. Nothing here knows a unit, a

 * class accumulates and tells it when a leg or a timer ended. The legacy
 * MovementGeneratorType conversions live with the shim, outside this seam.
