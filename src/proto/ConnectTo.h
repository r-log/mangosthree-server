     * @brief Builds the signed SMSG_CONNECT_TO that opens the second stream.
     *
     * The client will not open stream 1 for an unsigned redirect. It holds an
     * RSA-2048 public key and runs a raw public operation on the packet's
     * 256-byte field, P = C^e mod n, then checks the recovered plaintext's
     * internal structure against constants baked into the image. Only the holder
     * of d can produce a C that recovers to a structure that passes -- which is
     * the whole point of the mechanism, and the reason the modulus in the client
     * has to be replaced with one whose private half we hold. A client running
     * the stock modulus refuses every redirect we can sign, and then holds all
     * 729 of its stream-1 opcodes forever.
     *
     * What the recovered plaintext has to contain is not a format we chose:
     *
     *   - a 142-byte block of the digits of pi in BCD, which the client
     *     regenerates from an internal spigot and compares byte for byte;
     *   - a control byte of 0x2A;
     *   - the destination address, its family, and the port, in a fixed layout;
     *   - two HMAC-SHA1 tags over that layout, keyed with a 64-byte constant.
     *
     * The address is the one field that is easy to get wrong in a way that looks
     * like a signing bug: it is the destination the CLIENT must connect to --
     * this server's own advertised address -- and never the client's own address.
     * Writing the peer address here makes the client connect to itself, and the
     * symptom is an accept on :8086 that never happens.
