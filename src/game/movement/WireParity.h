/**
 * @brief What is left of the shadow now that the movement record reads and
 *        writes through the registry itself (P2-B). Design v2 §13.
 *
 * MovementInfo::Read decodes every inbound status through the registry with
 * nothing beside it to compare against any more, so P1's Inbound, Relay,
 * InboundMover and InboundTeleportAck -- each a comparison against a legacy
 * reader that no longer exists -- are gone along with their call sites. Two
 * counters take their place, both minimal: Task 3 gives each a proper row and
 * report line, but landing them now lets this task's own smoke witness the
 * flip.
 *
 *  - Rejected: a packet the codec could not decode. MovementInfo::Read counts
 *    it and throws; the tree's own bad-packet handling
 *    (WorldSession::Update's log-and-maybe-kick) takes it from there. Counted
 *    whether or not the shadow is on -- this is production behaviour now, not
 *    an observation of it.
 *  - BridgeCheck: under the shadow only. Whether MovementBridge's ToWire,
 *    given the record FromWire just filled in, reproduces the status the
 *    codec decoded off the wire -- the bridge's own round-trip witness, not
 *    the reader's.
 *
 * Outbound is unchanged: it still judges every packet the wire layer knows,
 * of either kind (a registry layout or a family), by decoding it whole and
 * re-encoding what it decoded -- a packet that decodes but does not reproduce
 * its own bytes is counted as `inexact` rather than as a failure, because the
 * decode was sound and it is the writer or the encoder that disagrees.
