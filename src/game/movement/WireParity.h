/**
 * @brief The wire codec run in shadow beside the legacy movement reader and
 *        writers, counting where they disagree. Design v2 §13 P1: passive.
 *
 * Nothing here changes what the server does: the legacy MovementInfo still
 * feeds every handler and the legacy writers still build every packet. The
 * shadow decodes a copy, compares, counts, and drops the result. Off unless
 * Movement.WireParity is set; then every hook is one atomic load.
 *
 * Two legacy quirks are counted apart, not as mismatches, because they are
 * known and each has its own fate:
 *
 *  - labelSwapped: the legacy header and the registry disagree about which of
 *    the two fall-direction floats is the cosine. P1-B's real-client golden
 *    settled the 28 layouts where the legacy header's labels were suspect --
 *    the client's own bytes agree with them, the registry now emits those
 *    labels, and the bin can no longer fire for any of the 28. It can still
 *    fire for the two the same flip moved the other way,
 *    CMSG_MOVE_SET_RUN_MODE and CMSG_MOVE_SET_WALK_MODE, which the legacy
 *    header labels the CPP way (MovementCodecTest's kLegacyFallAngleSwapped).
 *    Only an airborne run/walk toggle produces such a packet, and the golden
 *    has none, so those two are unproven either way: a parity run that catches
 *    one lands it in this bin, and that is the evidence that would settle
 *    them. The bin therefore outlives P1.
 *
 *  - vehicleIdInFallTime: the legacy reader stores a transport's vehicle id
 *    into fallTime (P2 retires that reader). The bin only fires on a packet
 *    that carries both a fall block and a transport vehicle id: ToWire reads
 *    fallTime only when the legacy status says hasFallData, so the commoner
 *    corruption -- the vehicle id landing in fallTime on a packet with no fall
 *    block at all -- is masked there and counted nowhere. A 0 in that column
 *    is not evidence that the defect is absent.
 *
 * Boundary: Inbound runs only from HandleMovementOpcodes, so the registered
 * inbound acks (CMSG_FORCE_*_CHANGE_ACK, CMSG_MOVE_SET_CAN_FLY_ACK, ...) --
 * which have their own handlers -- are captured and replayed, but never
 * compared against the legacy reader here. That is the plan's scope, not a
 * defect; P1-C must not read these counters as covering them.
