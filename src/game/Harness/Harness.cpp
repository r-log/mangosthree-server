        //    the process-wide authority totals -- poisoning the one signal (added != removed)

        //    _player (WorldSession.cpp:168-180) and the removal has already deleted him, and it
        //    also resolves the other members through ObjectLookup, which reads the registry;
        //    after SetPlayer(NULL) it is a silent no-op, with `removed` still never counted.

        //    (WorldSession.cpp:806) and Unit::RemoveFromWorld both pass
        //    GameTime::GetGameTimeMS() -- and it stays deterministic here because GameMSTime is
        //    refreshed from WorldClock, which only Step() moves while the harness runs.
        // 2. The registry removal, while the guid still resolves to him.
