// against a target that walks a straight line, stops, reverses and then circles, and where
// it comes to rest against one that cannot move at all; the follow's pace and band behind a
// running leader, the leader's facing copied at rest and the travel facing kept on a leg,
// and a leader that changes the KIND of its movement under the follower; the evade that
// waits under a root and runs its arrival recipe exactly once. Every scenario spawns its own
