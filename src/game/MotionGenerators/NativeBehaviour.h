/**
 * One held behaviour of the movement kernel's shell (design v2 §3-§4): a native of the kernel
 * (src/motion) over the per-unit driver. The arbiter decides which one is selected; the shell
 * calls these hooks in the order the arbiter's events dictate and ticks the selected one. The
 * adapter owns the native and a MotionDriver, fills the Sight, applies the Step's intent through
 * the driver or the launcher, writes the roaming pair, and performs an Outcome's recipe in order
 * with its predicates read live. Since P5-B family 2 it is also the native's Motion::Services
 * port: every draw and every route the native asks for runs here, over the unit and the
 * adapter's own path query. Since P5-C nothing else implements a shell behaviour: the name says
 * what it holds, a native of the kernel.
